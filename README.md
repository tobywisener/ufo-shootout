# ufo-shootout
Topical top down shooter game based on the recent UFO shootdowns over Alaskan and Canadian borders

In this hilarious and addictive game, you are tasked with defending the skies against an alien invasion. Armed with an array of weapons, you must shoot down as many UFOs as possible before they destroy the world. But watch out for the occasional Chinese spy balloon that will reduce your health or firepower if you shoot it.
